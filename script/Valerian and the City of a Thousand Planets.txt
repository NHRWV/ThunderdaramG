And with a policy, the community will use all the resources that exist,
To release the space station from Earth's gravity.

-Where it comes from? -From Muel.
The planet is located in the constellation of QN34.
-First. -Yes.
The planet is no more during the last 30 years.
Let's see its exact appearance.
There are vegatasi very much, where ancient creatures but very interesting.
My dream is also quite interesting.

Leaving the eksospace in 1 minute.
She is very sweet, you know, and very interesting.

I will ask you 10 times longer and I will bring you to the most beautiful beach in the universe.
But we will do so in a timely manner.
The perfect place to honeymoon.
10 seconds.
After the wedding comes the honeymoon, you know that right?
Seriously? -Yes.
3, 2, 1 set off. ..
-Alex, what are you doing? -Sorry, the traffic is too crowded ...
-What need I driving? -No, no, thank you.
Welcome to Alpha, the city's thousands of planets.
-Alex, can you explain his condition? -I set up a file.
Alpha stations are already growing 7 percent this year.
And since its off of the terrestrial orbit, where it's already ventured as far as 700 million miles.
-Population? -Nearly 30 million.
3236 species from the four corners of the universe is here.
Mixing knowledge and their culture.
More than 5000 languages here, and not the language of the computer.
Demographics.
In the South there is a section setting inhabited 800 species in any type of liquid.
Like farmers, who cultivate Polom Cobalt.
In the North there is a carbonated areas inhabited by Azimo.
That's because sensitivitasnya, they meant the question of Science and molecular components of the nerve.
They can makes cells of any kind.
To the East, the great Olight colony.
They control information technology, finance, and banking.
Finally in the West, in a pressurized atmosphere, we have 9 million man and similar species.
My House my house.
The economy is not good the last few years. You want summarized?
No, that's enough for one day.
Intruder SP 92, authorization to land in doc section 1, VIP access.
Oh, we are famous for.
You're too late, the Mayor.
Sorry Sir, conditions are more complicated than our ekspektasikan.
You guys were assigned to the West and you're not disappointed, so am I.
I'll remember that, Sir.
And you, did you already check konduktornya?
He is in top condition.
May I ask what happened?
Follow me.
Open confidential files.
One year ago we found radioactive zone in central sections.
No signal could penetrate and probe we send nothing back.
So we send a special unit.
Its mission is to approaching as close as possible to the Centre and the identification of the problem.
And?
There is nothing to go back to live life.
There's an idea that strikes it what?
It is not.
This is the situation we are today.
The air in the zone were not functioning, highly contaminated.
And he continues to grow, such as viruses.
Excuse me, but we have to loose that part as soon as possible.
If not then he could destroy us all in less than 1 week.
Can we have a reason destroys Alpha and destroying many species?
This is a result of the work of weapons of mass destruction by whoever he is.
This is a threat to all species.
-Commander. -Prime Minister.
The cause of all this is already able to green light, but we recommend that international law and the sovereignty of the area remains respected.
Of course, that was indeed targetku.
Valerian and his teammates will be there for perlindunganmu.
Sir, it's not necessary. I have a unit of K-Tron can. ..
This was a direct order from the Government. They can also mengases this problem.
-All right. -The master of the masters ...
Miss, good luck.
Since we are on the same team, can you give details of operations?
I'll talk to the security council shortly.
There will be all the details you need to know.
It would be much more fun.
Hey handsome, you look more attractive.
You know, I've heard a lot about you in school.
I wonder if they said it was.
Wow, you have to come shopping with me.
Wait me here.
- He's ready? - Not yet.
We can not be anything, but I'm trying new things.
Once again. If this fails, finish him.
Ya pak.
If there is something wrong with this operation, you know what you should do.
Wow, I think you seriously consider my refuge.
It has become our duty.
Are you sure you want to come, this is the mission that danger.
This incident is the first incident that occurred in the history of this place.
.. will be very useful jka I have to be alone ..
You only negotiate on the table.
You're gonna take care of my safety,
... I'll take care of the negotiations.
I do not think it's a good idea.
For your personal safety, let him keep the animal.
I do not think so, it's against protocol, I was the highest-ranking officer in ..
This is a rare specimen whose oversight handed to us.
That is why we are holding it.
All right.
Just do not get in my way.
Commander, the board is waiting.
Okay, let's do this.
Stay here.
- On the way to the meeting. - Okay, sir.
You watch the back, I was in front.
Ya pak!
Everyone, thank you for coming quickly.
As a representative of the Human Federation, I asked for this meeting to explain our emergency conditions.
Seperti yang kalian tahu, jantung dari Stasiun Alpha terkontaminasi dengan kekuatan yang tidak jelas.
The Federation had sent the man a few battleships to prevent widening threat.
And they all failed and suffered considerable losses.
Analyze all the scary threats and develop these, Federations search for. ..
All is fine.
Did you miss the part of the excitement.
Yeah don't worry, we'll soon be at the beach.
I can now answer the question all the details of this operation.

-This is a sensitive matter. -It's a big problem.
-As Mayor Sam. -Alex?
Mayor Sam died one year ago.
What? Yes, in a strange way.
-No need to explain. -How strange.
I think you're not a doctor, right?
This is valuable information.
-He's dead. -Vain.
If you have any information on this planet, I'm interested.
Glad I could help.
Before we go we want to give you the info.
For free.
Free? You must be crazy.
-Machine switches. -A very expensive.
-The army will come. -And steal it.
What kind of soldiers?
- The first tip is .. - You'll want to know.
But you will get a discount, of course.
General, there is a problem at the station B.
- Alex, what is it? - Dozens of unidentified creature approached.
Undetectable for now.
It seems like the info you lose the price.
Now get out.
Go you!
Which direction they go in?
From where, they pass through walls.
Alex, I need some info about it.
Everyone, please evacuate.
- I can not read their DNA. - What?
- Sir, the door was locked. - We can not get out.
- Log. - I'm in.
- Evacuation commander. - OK.
General, secure the door.
- Commander, we have to evacuate you. - Come on.
This door does not work.
Alex, Open the door.
- What's that? - Team.
They kidnapped the commander. Take this, find General, tell him to keep track of them.
Okay.

Everyone returned to the post!
Hang as much as possible, a level five emergency.
All right.
Turn biovisual.
Okay, we get them, try to find the commander.
Okay, we can them. He was close to the dock, you're there.
Okay.
Where the most rapid pathway to get there?
North-east, 130 degrees.
60, 70, 80, 90th
- It's the wall. - You say you want the fastest way.
This is not the easiest way.
Forward. You almost got it.
Tunneling from other vessels, no message of their module.
Valerian, cancel, change of plans.
140 degrees to the East, Alex will pick you up.
-81? Actually, 81, straight.
-Are you sure? -Yes, I'm sure.
Because I was just thrown off into space.
-Sorry, my fault. It was number 18. -Does nothing.
We all do mistakes. Any idea how to get out of here?
Alex, picked him at 81.
Oh..
I'm already logged in.
Back to home.
I'm not sure you where, but I knew I had to send you to an extents.
Valerian, hold, we analyze the system of defence.
Major, we will lead you.
What if they have something bigger?
Where its commander?
Direction 9. The lower level. Hurry up.
It's her, don't miss him.
Valerian, carefully.
Penyusupnya are being followed, I will be riding in his small plane.
Okay.
Okay, Valerian, you are in the dangerous zone.
Their fishing rods before I Kau.
I was trying.
-Valerian, you need to be faster. -Damn.
Valerian, you have 10 seconds before I Kau.
Feel it.
Now, who's smart?
Valerian, you've got the time of 5 seconds.
Oh, no.
-Valerian. -I could not reduce speed.
-Oh, come on. -Enter the red zone.
-Yes! -Enter the red zone.
Valerian, do you hear me?
It's not clear! They approached.
Valerian, just answer!
-Valerian, answer me! -Major, just answer.
-Alex, are you able to help? -There are too many distractions.
I lost the signal mayornya.
Valerian?
Valerian?
Valerian, what you heard?
We miss him.
-You want to where? -Take my SkyJet.
-You will not catch up with him. -Why not?
The zone was controlled by our enemies, it is too dangerous.
Enemies that are not known to us. -The enemy that attacked us.
With wounding one man of us.
Why did they let one person alive? Give me a reason.
-I don't know. Valerian-never seen this creature.
-They are from the planet Mule. -Planet Mule was destroyed 30 years ago.
It does not make sense.
That's our mission, it makes no sense, Sir.
Someone is lying to us. I'm going to find out, I would save rekanku.
Major-General, Valerian is a valuable agent.
You can't miss him.
I can't lose you both in one day.
Hold him.
Give a signal of danger.
And a swatch of his commanders.
Yes, Sir.
Listen, I don't want to tell you guys how to do the task, but you guys aren't you guys supposed to be memborgolku?
First, it was because of Protocol. Second, because I very much wanted to escape.
A nice effort, comrades.
We have to talk.
If you guys didn't help me find Valerian, then the bullet will find you.
-You first. -Don't, don't, don't ...
-To avoid situations like this.. -All our information..
Split with 3 way, kill one of us..
-And you kill information. -That's too bad.
Okay. You have to give me a credit card, because I don't have enough money.
-Very difficult. -If its commander is here ...
-He can pay us. -But he was kidnapped.
Precisely, because the other exchanger is on you.
-Except, for security reasons. .. -Someone else took it. ..
How do you guys get that information?
-It's not the info ... -Only the conclusion.
-We know the workings of human beings. -They are easy to guess.
It's obvious you guys have never met a woman.
-Okay, okay. -Calm down.
-What do you want to know? -Location Of Valerian.
-It is difficult to say. -We know how to track them.
Location precisely.
-How much does it cost? 100,-per person.
Lupakanlah it.
It is only this that I have.
Berlianmu is worthless to us.
His negotiations are over.
-We mempercayaimu. -And in a situation like this ...
-We approve the deal. -Good.
Now I bring to Valerian. Now, too.
Follow us.
He sends the location where mayornya disappeared.
Laureline agents track and catch him.
-Notify all staff. -Yes, Sir.
Give me a few minutes.
View the file.
I need information about planet Mool.
Who has authority over this file?
DITO ACCESS ALK
We do not like this place.
Give it to me.
Too bad you guys should give it.
Bingo.
What do you want?
-We want to fishing. -Fish.
-If that's possible, Sir. -Thank you.
Nice. Not in this season.
These.
-It's not a good catch. -This.
Welcome to.
Uh, lower it.
-Lose, lose the thing. -Who is this?
UH..
Bromosaurus.
What's a dangerous?
Not too. Carefully, lest they menghirupmu.
There. That it was a male.
How do you know?
The males are smaller than females.
How do you know that it's got a jellyfish?
All males have a jellyfish. Bromosaurus pulled out of the water, it takes the jellyfish to live.
That's why they live there all year round.
That's where they get their food.
One day ...
What I can help? I'm a great driver.
Now..
This, this, Yes!
-Do you see it? -What?
-Seat belt. -Why have you not told me of yesteryear?
-I told you when you accept the invitation. -Good.
By the way, I'm Bob.
Hai.
There is no time. Jellyfish cortex is very fragile.
-It will show the position of Valerian. -It shows what he saw.
-Certainly, but, how? -Put it in bahumu.
-You are kidding? -Not when we're working.
-If you do it. -You will be able to communicate.
-Carefully. -With what is in it.
-For longer than 1 minute.. -It will take ...
-Ingatanmu. -Good.
At least I know I'm willing to attach my head into her mouth.
-Actually, it's not his mouth. -You can start.
Right now.
-Don't forget ... -1 minutes, not more.
We have to count them.
Uh, the smell ...
We start.
This is very interesting.
Valerian.
-30 seconds. -Valerian.
No! No!
Valerian.
40 seconds.
Valerian.
-50 seconds. -Quit now!
55 seconds!
Valerian!

Anyone know it?
The level of 630, East.
The possibility has been inactive.
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
You need a map that detail?
We found traces of Sergeant Laurelie here.
What he is doing in its?
Don't know, Sir.
He stole a vehicle. He headed into the red zone.

Daughter ... she led me.
Princess. He lead you?

Advanced.
We have been manipulated from the start.
- What do you mean? - We're in the dead zone of dangerous.
It seems that contamination may have occurred.
Who is behind all this mess.
What?
- herus. - My name is Zui, I am the son of the Emperor.
- I thought you were going to introduce us to your father. - He is waiting.
Try to contact the General. Tell this location. I will be playing for time.
What if you are calling in reinforcements this time?
Hard to believe.
Follow me.
I want you to meet my father, the Emperor.
My name is and this is my wife Yemay Haba Aloy.
How are you? We are happy to receive you here.
My son felt the presence of his sister, Princess Nina in you.
It seems he has chosen you.
What do you mean?
When we die, we leave our body's energy in the form of waves.
Which will through time and space.
Sometimes the energy it will find a new body.
Daughter Nina was chosen to be the guardian of his soul.
I told you.
My child...
I am very happy to see you.
Same with me.
She also.
What actually happened to you all?
Our planet is very beautiful and we live in harmony with the elements.
Our activities are fishing and collecting energy.
That energy makes fertile soil, control the wind and the waves.
Two years we performed on land and sea.
We lived in harmony for centuries.
Until doomsday arrives.
The sky outside our planet a big battle going on.
The war between the two parties, we do not recognize.
- The missile is ready, sir. - fired missiles!
- Do you confirm, sir? - Yes.
Ready to carry out, sir.
May God forgive you.
- They died in the fighting? - Yes.
6 million others.
What happens after the explosion?
We float in space for years.
On board the remainder of the war.
The ship was half destroyed.
Come back to your room.
This environment is very different for us. We took at first.
We learn how it works.
We learn, language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and folisofi.
We learned about the millions of planets, stars and moon in the universe.
We never know.
And we learn which species are there in the universe.
Including people who have destroyed our planet.
Time has healed our loss.
But we learn to forget grudges against the responsible.
They're coming.
Then one day we met with merchants galaxy.
After a few years, our ship is completed.
And we headed into a giant construction site.
-Tesla. -True, the city millions of planets.
For millions of years many species of knowledge sharing.
We hid and learn everything.
Until we have the knowledge and materials to create our own ships.
Our planet was destroyed and we were trying to recreate the relpikanya ...
and restore our lost world.
-Incredible. -There are two things we want.
-Great Energy. -And the Pearl.
Only one who successfully obtained Zui.
We are happy, it made us as a witness to the massacre.
Witness that humans once ruled and tried to forget about it forever.
We could memfaatkan but how can we forget.
So, there is no choice but to steal the Converter.
-With the help of a professional Suriha. -I stole it from Suriha.
Converter.
But Valerian, and take that Converter.
Which left you one choice, captured commanders, forcing him to tell the truth.
You know how to get it done. Our ditanganmu destiny.
What is it? Where is this?
-Keep me from them, they are really bernahaya.
- Mutiara itu, dari planet U. - Aku pernah mendengar cerita konyol itu,
Tapi itu tidak mungkin. Planet U tidak dapat ditinggali.
Keberadaan mereka membuktikan sebaliknya, bukan?
I tell you, there is no life on the planet.
Detected on Gatacalicor. And the rest..
- How are you sure? - Because I wrote the report.
You wrote it?
Yes. yes, I was there.
That is something that should not be feared.
Our crew in the investigation, we lost 500,000 soldiers in one day.
It was fully chaos.
You're very busy so do not detect any sign of life of the planet.
Or even worse, you know the planet is uninhabited, and you sacrifice him.
Commander, the planet has a life.
Primitive life forms ?.
No, Commander. I detect the use of energy there and very complex.
Revenge, history is running ..
You and some primitive people there will not be able to hinder this history.
So you're aware that there were no survivors of Planet U and you heard about this.
You've decided to destroy them ..
Despite whatever the consequences.
I want no one survived.
You have to destroy all evidence of the mayor Sam had to fight.
What do you expect me to do?
It's the only way.
I admit, this is one of, if you deploy these events, there will be chaos everywhere.
and compensation. Economic planet could never recover.
Do you want it? We will lose our sovereignty and everything.
And we will be isolated. We will be denied access in all the planet. Science, technology.
What is it that you want?
Make their civilization declined.
Forcing them back 1000 years ago.
Hall we swore to me, to protect civilians us first.
And foremost, it is a chore!
My duty. And your job !!!
Or are you better off letting a risk to our economic woes for the sake of a few ..
Primitive people?
You're absolutely forced into this problem, do not confuse that which the enemy.
He is the ruler. He is the enemy.
You yourself are your worst enemy, Commander.
Unless you make up with your past. You will not have a future.
Major. I command you to arrest this man.
Can we talk man to man for a moment?
Hey, what are you doing?
I who mengajarinyan way of doing it.
Nice conversation.
Road, street, road.
- Section 1-2 has become a red zone. - Prepare the cleaning section 2.
Look, it's very fun, but we have to report to our people.
This. This is yours.
I gave this as a promise. Let's go. What are you doing.
I gave Converter back to them.
No, no.
- Mutiara itu tidak berguna tanpa alat ini. - Ya, tapi..
- Bisa berikan kami waktu sebentar? Ayo. - Apa?
Converter adalah milik pemerintah. Ini alat yang terakhir diseluruh alam semesta.
Jadi kau mengikuti filosofi komandan. Milikku adalah milikku, dan sekali milikmu adalah milikku.
Tidak, aku hanya menjalankan tugasku. Kita tidak memiliki kewajiban menyerahkannya.
Federasi harus dihentikan. Dan harus bertanggungjawab atas insiden ini.
Ya, aku setuju tapi ini bukan kita yang memutuskan.
Serahkan ke Cort.
Mereka juga pembohong, hanya kita saja yang bisa berbuat benar.
Baiklah, aku seorang prajurit.
Aku menaati peraturan.
That's what makes me be myself.
Do you know,
That's why I do not want to marry you. Because you do not understand love.
No, come on, this has nothing to do with love.
That's where you're wrong.
Love is stronger than any other.
It breaks all the rules, overcome all the power, even though the team.
Just look at him.
Just for a moment you are in position.
He lost all of his people and their children.
And he is willing to forgive.
That is true love.
Is to trust others. And ..
I think I could be someone for you.
- But obviously .. - You can.
You can trust me.
I would die for you.
I did not ask you to die for me.
I'm asking you to trust me.
All right. Give it to them.
Ya.
thanks.
We were blamed for the loss of your planet and we will be honored to help you get it back.
This.
thanks.
That is ... thanks.
Spread. Spread.

And wherever.
We've set it up, ready to leave this place.
Accepted, evacuation zones. You've got 4 minutes.
Implemented now.
Valager, there are hundreds of soldiers around the spaceship.

So you do not have to be forever defense.
One call alone.
